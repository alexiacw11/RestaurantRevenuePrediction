# RestaurantRevenuePrediction
This is a report and code for my machine learning final project, which also happens to be the Kaggle Restaurant Revenue Prediction Competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/restaurant-revenue-prediction.

## Project Goal
This project aims to develop a model capable of predicting annual restaurant sales based on objective measurements across 100,000 regional locations. Opening new restaurants is time-intensive and costly; selecting a good location is essential to avoid losses. A model that can identify worthwhile restaurant locations would allow TFI to allocate resources in other areas.

## Business Problem
TFI is known for expanding restaurant brands internationally through creative marketing and operations (e.g. Popeyes, Arbyâ€™s, Burger King, Sbarro, etc.). Knowing where to open new restaurants is largely based on the judgment and experience of diverse development teams. Different geographies and cultures can make this a challenging task. When poor locations are chosen, the sites are typically closed within eighteen months. Developing a model to reliably predict a restaurant's success, based on location, is essential for TFI.
